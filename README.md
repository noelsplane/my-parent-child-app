   `git clone https://github.com/noelsplane/my-parent-child-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory with: 
    `cd my-parent-child-app`
3. Install dependencies with:
`npm install`
4. Start the development server with:
    `npm start`
5. Open your browser and navigate to 'http://localhost:3000'
