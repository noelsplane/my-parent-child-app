# React Homework App

## Introduction
This is a simple React app that demonstrates parent-to-child and child-to-parent communication. Clicking the button in the child component triggers a state update in the parent component, which updates the childâ€™s content.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
    `cd my-parent-child-app`
3. Install dependencies with:
```npm install
4. Start the development server:
    npm start
5. Open your browser and navigate to 'http://localhost:3000'
